flask cors playground
=====================

1. create a new venv
1. install requirements 
2. put flask in debug mode to aid testing `export FLASK_ENV=development`
3. launch a couple of terminal windows and then launch both the backend and the
web server:
    * `flask run`
    * `python -m http.server`

Hit http://localhost:8000 and open the console to test

Based on the excellent example from: https://github.com/PrettyPrinted/youtube_video_code/tree/master/2019/08/06/CORS%20in%20Flask
